Exporting components :

1. Enables the use of a component in other parts.
2. Default Export: Allows exporting a single component as the default from a module.
3. Named Export: Allows exporting multiple items from a module.
4. Importing: To use an exported component, you need to import it in the destination file using import syntax
   Eg: import Hello from "./Hello"; OR export default "FunctionName"
