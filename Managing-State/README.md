# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.


<h1> Managing State</h1><br>

1. State represents data that changes over time.
2. State is local and private to the component.
3. State changes cause the component to re-render.
4. For functional components, use the useState hook.
5. React Functions that start with word use are called hooks
6. Hooks should only be used inside components
7. Parent components can pass state down to children via props.
8. Lifting state up: share state between components by moving it to their 
closest common ancestor
